2. **Ask something deep** (+2 affection)
3. **Invite to activity** (varies)
4. **Say goodbye** (ends interaction)

## üíï Mastering the Affection System

### Understanding Affection Points
- Start at 0 affection with each agent
- Minimum affection is always 0 (can't go negative)
- Different endings trigger at different thresholds

### Affection Sources
| Action | Points | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Compliment | +1 | Safe, reliable option |
| Deep conversation | +2 | Best return on investment |
| Successful activity | +2 | Depends on agent preferences |
| Failed activity | -1 | Reduced to 0 minimum |
| Cancelled activity | 0 | No penalty for backing out |

### Optimal Strategy
For maximum affection in minimum interactions:
1. Start with a deep conversation (+2)
2. Try an activity they'll enjoy (+2)
3. Give a compliment (+1)
4. Another deep conversation (+2)
Total: 7 affection in 4 moves!
